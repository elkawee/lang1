From the erlang shell : run with 

lang1:run ( filename )  // file from the current directory  , or 
lang1:run ( expression ) 

features : 
	lambdas , closures , higher order functions 

-> there is no parser , programs are erlang terms like 

	['let' , [ x , 5 ],   <other expression>  ] . 

	the final dot is required by the erlang evaluator 

-> a program is a single expression and returns a single value 

-> there are no useful error messages >_> 
	both , forgotten colons and arity mismatches return the most cryptic error
	message possible
